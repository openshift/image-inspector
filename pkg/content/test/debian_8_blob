 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.

 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
